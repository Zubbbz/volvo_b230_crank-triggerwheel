## Compatibility: 
It may work on other red-blocks, but I have only tested on my B230F.

## Hall Sensor Mount:
I made my own mount for [this sensor](https://www.diyautotune.com/product/crank-position-sensor-hall-effect-tab-mount/) from diy DiyAutoTune. Inlcuded is also a dimensionally accurate model of the sensor itself. I used a 3d printer to print it out so i could make the mount around it and check fitment before I ordered the actual sensor. I made it by hand with 3/16in thick steel plate and then modeled after it. I added some reinforcement ribs to help keep vibration down. The model included is roughly what the mount I made is. **Be weary** that those front two bolts on the oil pan that I make use of are threading into aluminum and there is minor thread enagement. I ended up stripping them out and needing to repair the threads with helicoils.
